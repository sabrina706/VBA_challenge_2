The sources I got my code from were from reviewing recordings of past classes, and 2 tutoring sessions with CJ and Carlos as well as peers reviewing my work and critiquing little snips of my work. I looked up VBA loops off stack overflow. I submitted one version and saw it didnt match the example and went back and fixed it with conditional formatting.
